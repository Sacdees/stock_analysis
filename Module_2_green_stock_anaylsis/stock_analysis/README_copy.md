# VBA Macros with Excel to Automate

## Overview of Project -
Steve has recently graduated and his begining a new career in the Financial Services Industry.  His parents are so proud of Steve, that they have decided to be his first customer.  His parents are passionate about Green Energy and after some research have decided to invest is DAQO - a solar panel producer.  Steve would like to help divesify their portfolio to more than just DAQO and has provided this data to help make executive decisions.  



## Analysis and Challenges - 
Before we begin with our new analytical request, let us state that we intially ran a quick VBA code to get the information delivered to Steve as fast as possible. His first client - parents - are set on investing in alternative energy such as bio, hydro, geothermal and wind.  He would like to use this document to help convince the clients to spread their investments rather than put all their money into one particular stock. To

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
As you can see in the graph below, May was by far the most successful month to launch a theater campaign, and the data continued to have the highest number of outcomes through out early spring until end of summer September. One will notice a small uptick in October followed by a large consistent drop for the rest of the year. With the uptick in October, there was also an increase in failed campaigns and would advise a word of caution to begin during this time period.  For the rest of the months the number of failed campaigns does not have any drastic spikes, with the biggest increase, correlating with the signifcant increase in successful campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Calculating the successful and failed outcomes based on simply on goal expectations data demonstrate a less clear picture as to the correct avenue in which to proceed.  Outcomes with higher goal setting have a high success rate but there is also a signicant gap between the mean data observed in the graph.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
We would recommend using caution with this data as the outliers may be affecting the true representation of success.  Recommendation would be to perform more extensive data analysis that would account for removing possible obscurring factors corrupting the data.

## Results
The overall outlook for a successful campaign in either the United States or Great Britain would be significantly increased if the campaign started in late spring or early summer, with May and June being the two most desirable time periods.  A quick look at the graphs below can help demonstrate this analysis.
