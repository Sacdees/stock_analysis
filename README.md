# VBA Macros with Excel to Automate Rate of Return for Green Industries
## An Analysis for our friend Steve in his new finance career
Our client Steve has presented us with an excel sheet and asked us to help analyze the data he collected for investing in **Green Energy**.

## Overview of Project -
Steve has recently graduated and his begining a new career in the Financial Services Industry.  His parents are so proud of Steve, that they have decided to be his first customer.  His parents are passionate about Green Energy and after some research have decided to invest is DAQO - a solar panel producer.  Steve would like to help divesify their portfolio to more than just DAQO and has provided this data to help make executive decisions.

### Analysis of Excel Workbook
Before we begin with our new analytical quest, let us state that we intially created a quick VBA code to get the information delivered to Steve as fast as possible. His first client - parents - are set on investing in alternative energy such as bio, hydro, geothermal and wind.  He would like to use this document to help convince the clients to spread their investments rather than put all their money into one particular stock. To

#### Advantages of refactoring
As you can see in the outcomes below, we were able to speed up this process a by changing the code a bit and removing the nested loops that were requiring multiple functions with in one category.  By seperating out the counting loops we were able to speed up the process and improve the consistency of the results 
#### Disadvantages of refactoring
However with the small sample size, the amount of time and effort put into making the process faster, and the time saved would be better spent invested in other processes.  With the original speeds rating on moving just slightly slower the improved code, we can see that the process is hardly noticeable to the end user.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered with both Original and Refactored
This process has determined that there is not many other options to speed up this data processing within the Excel program itself.  As our client starts to build more data documents for his clients, we would like to highly recommend letting us convert the data into a more user friendly and manageable platform, to help streamline future analysis with all compliling data and future data.  The limitation for proper analysis can be limited in Excel, althought very common in the financial industry we can help produce a more in depth system while allowing to still analyze and sorting stock information for each individual client.  


## Alternative Energy Worksheet Results
The overall outlook for the particular program was able to be manipulate the data per the request of our client Steve.  We were successfully able to add the ease of buttons, input boxes, and messages delivers to help make the task as hand easier for Steve.  The program should allow for growth of data with in the WorkBook as long as refactoring remained part of the process.  In order to properly include all the new data, this process would have to be repeated as new Worksheets were added to the document at large.
